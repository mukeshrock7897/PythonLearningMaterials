### **Operators**  
1. **What are the different types of operators in Python?**  
- Arithmetic, Relational, Logical, Identity, Bitwise, and Shorthand Assignment Operators.  

2. **What is the difference between  /  and  //  in Python?**  
-  /  performs normal division (returns float),  //  performs floor division (returns integer).  

3. **What does the  is  operator do?**  
- It checks if two variables refer to the same object in memory.  

4. **What is the output of  10 & 5 ?**  
-  0  (Bitwise AND of  1010  &  0101 ).  

5. **Explain  a += 1  and  a <<= 1 .**  
-  a += 1  is shorthand for  a = a + 1 .  
-  a <<= 1  is shorthand for  a = a << 1  (left shift).  

### **Loops**  
6. **What are the types of loops in Python?**  
-  while ,  for , and  nested loops .  

7. **How does a  while  loop work?**  
- It runs as long as the condition is  True .  

8. **What is the use of the  range()  function?**  
- It generates a sequence of numbers ( range(start, stop, step) ).  

9. **What will  for i in range(3): print(i)  output?**  
-  0 1 2   

10. **How does a nested loop work?**  
- A loop inside another loop, iterating multiple levels.  

### **Break and Continue**  
11. **What is the use of the  break  statement?**  
- It exits the loop immediately when encountered.  

12. **What is the use of the  continue  statement?**  
- It skips the current iteration and continues with the next one.  

13. **What will the following code print?**  
    
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        break
    print(i)
    
-  0 1 2   

14. **What will the following code print?**  
    
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        continue
    print(i)
    
-  0 1 2 4   

### **Decision Making**  
15. **What are the types of decision-making statements in Python?**  
-  if ,  if-else ,  nested if , and  if-elif ladder .  

16. **How does an  if  statement work?**  
- Executes a block of code if the condition is  True .  

17. **What is the output of the following?**  
    
x = 10
if x > 15:
    print("Greater")
print("End")
    
-  End  (since  x > 15  is  False ).  

18. **What is the  if-elif-else  ladder?**  
- It checks multiple conditions in sequence and executes the first  True  condition.  

19. **What does the following code do?**  
    
x = 10
if x == 10:
    print("Equal to 10")
    if x < 20:
        print("Less than 20")
    
- Prints:  
    
    Equal to 10
    Less than 20
