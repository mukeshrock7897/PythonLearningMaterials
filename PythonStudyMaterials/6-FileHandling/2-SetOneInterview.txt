### **Basic Questions**  

#### 1. **What is a file in Python?**  
**Answer:**  
A file is a document that contains information or data, stored permanently, allowing retrieval in the future.

#### 2. **What are the different types of files in Python?**  
**Answer:**  
Files in Python are of two types:  
- **Text files**: Store character data (.txt files).  
- **Binary files**: Store images, videos, audio, etc.  

#### 3. **How do you open a file in Python?**  
**Answer:**  
Using the  open()  function:  

f = open("example.txt", "r")


#### 4. **What are the different file modes in Python?**  
**Answer:**  
- **"r"**: Read mode (default).  
- **"w"**: Write mode (overwrites existing content).  
- **"a"**: Append mode (adds new data without deleting existing data).  
- **"r+"**: Read & write without overwriting data.  
- **"w+"**: Read & write, but overwrites data.  
- **"a+"**: Append & read.  
- **Binary modes**:  "rb", "wb", "ab", "rb+", "wb+", "ab+" .  

#### 5. **What happens if you open a non-existing file in read mode?**  
**Answer:**  
Python raises a  FileNotFoundError .

### **Intermediate Questions**  

#### 6. **What is the difference between  write()  and  writelines() ?**  
**Answer:**  
-  write(str) : Writes a single string to a file.  
-  writelines(list_of_strings) : Writes multiple lines from a list.  

Example:  

file = open("abc.txt", "w")
file.write("Hello, World!\n")
file.writelines(["Line 1\n", "Line 2\n"])
file.close()


#### 7. **How can you read a file in Python?**  
**Answer:**  
-  read() : Reads the entire file.  
-  read(n) : Reads  n  characters.  
-  readline() : Reads one line.  
-  readlines() : Reads all lines into a list.  

Example:  

file = open("abc.txt", "r")
print(file.read(5))  # Reads first 5 characters
print(file.readline())  # Reads one line
print(file.readlines())  # Reads all lines as a list
file.close()


#### 8. **What is the purpose of the  with  statement in file handling?**  
**Answer:**  
The  with  statement automatically closes the file after execution.  
Example:  

with open("example.txt", "w") as f:
f.write("Using with statement")
# No need to call f.close()


#### 9. **How can you check if a file exists in Python?**  
**Answer:**  
Using  os.path.isfile() :  

import os
print(os.path.isfile("example.txt"))  # True if file exists


#### 10. **What is the difference between  tell()  and  seek() ?**  
**Answer:**  
-  tell() : Returns the current file pointer position.  
-  seek(offset, from_where) : Moves the file pointer.  
-  from_where = 0  (default): Beginning of file.  
-  from_where = 1 : Current position.  
-  from_where = 2 : End of file.  

Example:  

file = open("abc.txt", "r")
print(file.tell())  # 0 (start)
file.read(5)
print(file.tell())  # 5 (after reading 5 characters)
file.seek(0)  # Move to the beginning
print(file.tell())  # 0
file.close()

### **Advanced Questions**  

#### 11. **How do you count the number of lines, words, and characters in a file?**  
**Answer:**  

import os

filename = "abc.txt"
if os.path.isfile(filename):
with open(filename, "r") as f:
    lines = f.readlines()

line_count = len(lines)
word_count = sum(len(line.split()) for line in lines)
char_count = sum(len(line) for line in lines)

print("Lines:", line_count)
print("Words:", word_count)
print("Characters:", char_count)


#### 12. **How do you handle exceptions while working with files?**  
**Answer:**  
Using  try-except :  

try:
f = open("nonexistent.txt", "r")
except FileNotFoundError:
print("File not found!")
finally:
if 'f' in locals():
    f.close()


#### 13. **What is the difference between  close()  and  with  statement?**  
**Answer:**  
-  close() : Requires manual file closure.  
-  with : Automatically closes the file.  

#### 14. **How can you open a file in append mode without overwriting existing content?**  
**Answer:**  
Using  "a"  mode:  

with open("abc.txt", "a") as f:
f.write("\nAppending data")


#### 15. **How do you read a binary file in Python?**  
**Answer:**  
Use  "rb"  mode:  

with open("image.jpg", "rb") as img:
data = img.read()
